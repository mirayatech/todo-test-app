### ðŸ“± My first project ever built with reactnative

This is my first project ever built with React Native. It's kind of like a todo app, where the user has an input field to write inside, and then they can click on the button to add a todo. All the todos will be displayed below the input container, and once you click on a todo, it disappears, indicating that you've completed the task.

### ðŸ“š What I learned:
- What is React Native?
- How it works under the hood of React Native
- The difference between using Expo and the React Native CLI
- Running the app on a real device (my phone)
- Running the app on a simulator (ios & android)
- Styling in React Native
- Handling events (onPress, etc.)
- Understanding Xcode and Android Studio

And much more!
